# Honeypot-and-Analysis

![](images/intro.jpg)

<br />
<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I designed and implemented a controlled honeypot environment using AWS EC2 instances. The honeypot was strategically configured to mimic vulnerable services, attracting potential attackers. Subsequently, I utilized Kibana, a powerful visualization and analysis tool, to parse and analyze the log information generated by the honeypot, gaining insights into attacker behavior and enhancing overall cybersecurity understanding.
